In this guide, we'll proceed through the following checklist one step at a time to get your application instrumented for
use with **Logfire**. At each step, we'll demonstrate what you can expect to see in the Logfire Web UI, and how to interact
with the data you're generating.

* [ ] **[Create a Logfire project for your application](01_create_a_project.md)**
* [ ] **[Integrate any existing logging with Logfire](02_integrate_existing_logging.md)**
    *  *Note: you can skip this step if you are working on a new project or don't have existing logging infrastructure.*
* [ ] **[Add OpenTelemetry instrumentations](03_add_otel_instrumentations.md)**
    * [TODO: Make sure to call out system metrics.]
* [ ] **[Add Logfire (manual) tracing](04_add_manual_tracing.md)**
* [ ] **[Add Logfire auto-tracing](05_add_auto_tracing.md)**
* [ ] **[Add Logfire metrics](06_add_metrics.md)**
