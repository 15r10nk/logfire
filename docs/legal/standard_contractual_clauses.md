**Last update: 2023-02-16**

This attachment is attached to and forms part of the [Logfire Data Processing Addendum](data_processing_addendum.md),
between Customer and Pydantic Services Inc. (**"PSI"**) governing the processing of Customer Personal Data (the "**Addendum**").
Unless otherwise defined in this attachment, capitalized terms used in this attachment have the meanings given to them
in the Addendum.

## SECTION I

### Clause 1 — Purpose and scope

The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)
for the transfer of personal data to a third country.

The Parties:

1. The natural or legal person(s), public authority/ies, agency/ies or other body/ies (hereinafter "entity/ies")
   transferring the personal data, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each "data exporter"), and
2. The entity/ies in a third country receiving the personal data from the data exporter, directly or indirectly via
   another entity also Party to these Clauses, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each "data importer")
   have agreed to these standard contractual clauses (hereinafter: "Clauses").

These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.

The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of these Clauses.

To the extent applicable hereunder, these Clauses also apply mutatis mutandis to the Parties' processing of personal
data that is subject to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Where applicable, references to EU Member State
law or EU supervisory authorities shall be modified to include the appropriate reference under Swiss law as it
relates to transfers of personal data that are subject to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection.

To the extent applicable hereunder, these Clauses, as supplemented by Annex III, also apply mutatis mutandis to the
Parties' processing of personal data that is subject to UK Data Protection Laws (as defined in Annex III).

### Clause 2 — Effect and invariability of the Clauses

These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective legal
remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with respect to data
transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, standard contractual clauses pursuant to
Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not modified, except to select the appropriate
Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix. This does not prevent the Parties from including the
standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or
additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the
fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.

These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.22

### Clause 3 — Third-party beneficiaries

Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter and/or data
importer, with the following exceptions:

Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter and/or
data importer, with the following exceptions:

* Clause 13;
* Clause 15.1(c), (d) and (e);
* Clause 16(e);
* Clause 18(a) and (b).

Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

### Clause 4 — Interpretation

Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have the same meaning
as in that Regulation.

These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided for in
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

### Clause 5 — Hierarchy

In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between the Parties,
existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall prevail.

### Clause 6 — Description of the transfer(s)

The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and the
purpose(s) for which they are transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.

### Clause 7 - Optional — Docking clause

## SECTION II -- OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

### Clause 8 — Data protection safeguards

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the
implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.

#### 8.1 Instructions

The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data
exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.

The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.

#### 8.2 Purpose limitation

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex
I. B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.

#### 8.3 Transparency

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties,
available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential
information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the
text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data
subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties
shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the
redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

#### 8.4 Accuracy

If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it
shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data
exporter to erase or rectify the data.

#### 8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data

Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the
provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal
data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the
data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or
returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to
the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will
continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required
under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under
Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is
or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).

#### 8.6 Security of processing

The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security
leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data
(hereinafter 'personal data breach'). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due
account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of
processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider
having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing
can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the
personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data
exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the
technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to
ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly
necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised
to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory
obligation of confidentiality.

In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses,
the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse
effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the
breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a
description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data
subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address
the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as,
it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the
information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without
undue delay.

The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its
obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the
affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data
importer.

#### 8.7 Sensitive data

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person's sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to
criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter 'sensitive data'), the data importer shall apply the specific
restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.

#### 8.8 Onward transfers

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data
exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same
country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter 'onward transfer') if the third party is or agrees
to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:

* the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU)
  2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
* the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679
  with respect to the processing in question;
* the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of
  specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
* the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
  person.22Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in
  particular purpose limitation.

#### 8.9 Documentation and compliance

The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the
processing under these Clauses.

The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep
appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.

The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with
the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter's request, allow for and contribute to audits of
the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-
compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held
by the data importer.

The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include
inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out
with reasonable notice.

The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits,
available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

### Clause 9 — Use of sub-processors

The data importer has the data exporter's general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an
agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to
that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least ten (10) days in advance, thereby giving
the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the
sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the
data exporter to exercise its right to object.

Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data
exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection
obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary
rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its
obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to
which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.

The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter's request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any
subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other
confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to
sharing a copy.

The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's
obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any
failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.

The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby -- in the event the
data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent -- the data exporter shall
have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the
personal data.

### Clause 10 — Data subject rights

The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It
shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.

The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects' requests
for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex
II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which
the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.

In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions
from the data exporter.

### Clause 11 — Redress

The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual
notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly with any
complaints it receives from a data subject.

In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that
Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each
other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.

Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept
the decision of the data subject to:

* lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of
  work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;
* refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.

The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association
under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.

The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and
procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.

### Clause 12 — Liability

Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of
these Clauses.

The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive
compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data
subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.

Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be
entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer
(or its sub- processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.
This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting
on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU)
2018/1725, as applicable.

The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data
importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that part of the
compensation corresponding to the data importer's responsibility for the damage.

Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these
Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an
action in court against any of these Parties.

The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the
other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.

The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.

### Clause 13 — Supervision

Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State, the following section applies: The supervisory
authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards
the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of
application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative
pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following section applies: The supervisory authority of
the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of
application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a
representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following section applies: The supervisory
authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these
Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as
indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory
authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees
to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority,
including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation
that the necessary actions have been taken.

## SECTION III — LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

### Clause 14 — Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses

The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of
destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to
disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from
fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that
respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in
a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not
in contradiction with these Clauses.

The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of
the following elements:

* The specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors
  involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of
  processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the
  transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
* The laws and practices of the third country of destination-- including those requiring the disclosure of data to
  public authorities or authorising access by such authorities -- relevant in light of the specific circumstances
  of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;
* any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards
  under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data
  in the country of destination.
* The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to
  provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data
  exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
* The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory
  authority on request.
* The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the
  duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line
  with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a
  measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with
  the requirements in paragraph (a).
* Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the
  data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify
  appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be
  adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data
  transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the
  competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the
  contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more
  than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party,
  unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d)
  and (e) shall apply.

### Clause 15 — Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities

#### 15.1 Notification

The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary
with the help of the data exporter) if it:

* receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of
  the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such
  notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal
  basis for the request and the response provided; or
* becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses
  in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information
  available to the importer.

If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the
country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with
a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document
its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data
exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on
the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether
requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).

The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the
contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and
Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.

#### 15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation

The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains
within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful
assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws
of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international
comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a
request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until
the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until
required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations
of the data importer under Clause 14(e).

The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to
the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data
exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for
disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

## SECTION IV — FINAL PROVISIONS

### Clause 16 — Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever
reason.

In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data
exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the
contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).

The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal
data under these Clauses, where:

* the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and
  compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of
  suspension;
* the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
* the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority
  regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at
the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same
shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data
exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these
Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the
transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses
and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.

Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a
decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which
these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which
the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in
question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

### Clause 17 — Governing law

These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party
beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland.

### Clause 18 — Choice of forum and jurisdiction

Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.

The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland.

A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of
the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.

The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.22
