## International data transfers

_PSI_ stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States,
and other countries where _PSI_, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal
Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not
recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the
standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under
[Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj),
help protect your rights and enable these protections
to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission's decisions on the adequacy of the protection of
personal data in the countries where _PSI_ processes personal data, see this article on the
[European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

## Data Privacy Framework (DPF)

_PSI_ also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and
the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. _PSI_ has
certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S.
DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the
EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. _PSI_ has
certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles
(Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the
Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles
and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework
(DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/>.

_PSI_ has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF)
Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on _PSI_'s behalf. _PSI_ shall remain
liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF
Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### Dispute resolution process

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, _PSI_ commits to
resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss
individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S.
DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first [contact us](#contact).

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not
addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit <https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html>
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are
provided at no cost to you.

An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF
compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information visit
<https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf>.

### Government Enforcement

_PSI_ is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of
the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the
DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations
through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.

## Security and Retention

_PSI_ uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We'll
retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply
with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of
data collection and any legal obligations.

## Security

_PSI_ uses administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate to protect your Personal Data.

such individuals. If you become aware that a minor has provided us with Personal Data, please [contact us](#contact).

your _PSI_ account.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

_PSI_ uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our
Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device
for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical
reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of _PSI_.

For Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise
users' interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content,
recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted
advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Marketing Pages,
the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have
opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and
to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session"
cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they
expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose
of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see
["What are your cookie choices and controls?"](#cookie-choices-controls).

#### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and
provide our Services. When visiting Marketing Pages, these and additional
cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser
connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers
and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web
server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called "single-pixel" or "clear GIFs") that are contained within a website or
email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web
server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about
your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded
videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites
access and use cookies. When visiting Marketing Pages, on a mobile device these
may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called "flash cookies" (also known as "Local Shared Objects" or "LSOs") to collect and store
information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The _PSI_ Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences
and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services,
develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be
provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and
advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you
visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your
online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. _PSI_ will place
non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

| Purpose           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Required Cookies  | _PSI_ uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.   |
| Analytics | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.                                                                                                                         |
| Social Media | _PSI_ and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on _PSI_'s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by _PSI_.                           |
| Advertising | In addition, _PSI_ and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |

#### What are your cookie choices and controls? {#cookie-choices-controls}

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

Any _PSI_ page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page's footer to cookie settings. You
can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:

- If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, _PSI_ will not set
  non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
- Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the
  documentation for your browser to learn more.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as
  [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third
  parties may be disabled.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as
  [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent
  that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
- You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If _PSI_ detects the GPC
  signal from your device, _PSI_ will not share your data (we do not sell your data).
  To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
- Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of
  ad targeting, which you can access at:
- United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
- Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
- Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers,
take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.
