# Privacy Policy

**Last update: 2023-02-16**

Pydantic Services Inc. (**"PSI"**, **"we"**, **"us"**, or **"our"**) provides a cloud-based Observability service, and
other software and services (the "**Services**"). This Privacy Policy explains our online and offline personal
information practices, the kinds of personal information we may collect, how we intend to use and share that personal
information, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.

## 1. Scope

This privacy policy governs our processing of personal information via our websites located at `pydantic.dev` and `logfire.dev` (the
"**Site**"), our Services, and any other _PSI_ websites, products, or services that link to this Privacy Policy. To
make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our Site, Services, websites, and other products and services are collectively
called "**Services**" This Privacy Policy is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America,
Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions. By using our Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of
personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**[An Important Note:]** This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the personal information that our
customers may collect and process using the _Logfire Cloud_ ("**Customer Data**"). Our customers are controllers of
the Customer Data and their respective privacy policies govern their collection and use of Customer Data. We act as a
processor for our customers' Customer Data and our processing of Customer Data is governed by the contracts that we have
in place with our customers, not this Privacy Policy. Any questions or requests relating to Customer Data should be
directed to our customers.

## 2. Personal Information We Collect And How We Use It {#personal-info}

The types of personal information we collect (directly from you or from third parties) and our privacy practices depend

  the privacy policy of the company providing it.
- **Information from Other Sources:** We may receive information about you from other sources, including through
  third-party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. This supplemental information
  allows us to verify information that you have provided to us and to enhance our ability to provide you with

#### B. "Do Not Track"

Do Not Track ("**DNT**") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT
is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits
collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals
or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

#### C. Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising

You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or
remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not
effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads
via their device settings. See [http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice).

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our
data partners and our Third-Party advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access
these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at
[https://optout.networkadvertising.org/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/),
or [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu),
[https://youradchoices.ca/](https://youradchoices.ca/) and
[https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info).

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be
performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your
computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.
Advertisements on third-party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have
been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These
advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based
advertising purposes. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use information regarding your activities on our
Services and/or information from the advertisements on third-party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes,
such as to determine how to optimize our Services.

commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide
